You said:
El gato es pequeno
ChatGPT said:
Good attempt! However, you wrote "El gato es pequeno", which means:

"The cat is pequeno." (You left "pequeño" in its unchanged form.)

Correction:
"Pequeno" is missing the tilde (ñ). In Spanish, "ñ" and "n" are different letters.
"Pequeño" correctly means "small."
Your sentence should be: "El gato es pequeño."

Great job! Now, here’s your next sentence:

Sentence: "The house is big."

You said:
El casa es grande
ChatGPT said:
Almost! But you wrote "El casa es grande.", which means:

"The casa is big." (You used the wrong article.)

Correction:
"Casa" is feminine, so "el" should be "la" instead.
Your sentence should be: "La casa es grande."
